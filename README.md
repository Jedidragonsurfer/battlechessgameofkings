Reporting Issues
----------------

If you encounter a bug while using BattleChess: Game of Kings, first search the [issue list](https://github.com/Olde-Skuul/battlechessgameofkings/issues) to see if it has already been reported. Include closed issues in your search.

If it has not been reported, create a new issue with at least the following information:

- a short, descriptive title;
- a detailed description of the issue, including any output from the command line;
- steps for reproducing the issue; and
- your [system information](#system-information).

Please place logs either in a code block (press `M` in your browser for a GFM cheat sheet) or a [gist](https://gist.github.com).

### System information

Your system information must include:
- your operating system (Windows/Linux/MacOSX)
- your Desktop/Window Manager
- your Graphics card info (manufacturer, card version), any and all graphics driver versions
- anything else that you think may be useful (mouse/keyboard, filesystem type, etc).

The preferred and easiest way to get this information is from Steam's Hardware Information viewer from the menu (`Help -> System Information`).

Once your information appears: right-click within the dialog, choose `Select All`, right-click again, and then choose `Copy`.
Paste this information into your report, preferably in a code block or a [gist](https://gist.github.com).
